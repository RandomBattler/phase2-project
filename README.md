Flatiron Phase 2 Project

This project is an app to simulate buying Cryptocurrencies. Here, the user can 
manage their portfolio making deposits and withdrawals of cash and buy and sell
from selected cryptocurrencies. 

The program uses GET and PATCH operations to display and update the user's assets.
Transactions will update the portfolio accordingly

The program uses the public API from CoinGecko to get the actual prices of 
the cryptos listed. 

Cash can be added freely with the deposit button, but crypto can only be 
bought with the cash in the account.
